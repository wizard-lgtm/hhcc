Holy Holy C is the superset of Holy-C.

In the memory of Terry A. Davis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYClgSGzWnI

remy clarke said python is kinda suitable for compiler development. it works tho, since the rust came up we don't give a sh*t about compile times as well. still i'm thinking about writing the compiler in rust when it's done
