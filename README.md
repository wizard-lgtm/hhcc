Holy Holy C is the superset of Holy-C.

In the memory of Terry A. Davis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYClgSGzWnI

remy clarke said python is kinda suitable for compiler development. it works tho, since the rust came up we don't give a sh*t about compile times as well. still i'm thinking about writing the compiler in rust when it's done


## Features

- LLVM-based: Compile to any target.
- Full Holy-C syntax support
- Class Methods & New Features
- Cross platform libc (Future planned)


## Current Status
The project is still under heavy development and isn't ready for use yet. Please check the issues for updates.  

I'm planning to release **version 0.1.0 by the end of April**.
